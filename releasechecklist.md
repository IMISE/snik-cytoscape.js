# Checklist before releasing a new version of SNIK Graph
Our releases have a major and minor version x.y with a corresponding milestone and git tag.

## Preparations

### Code
* switch to master branch
* git pull
* `npm install && npm update`
* `cp js/config.dist.js js/config.js`
* change the version number in package.json to the new release

### Upgrade major dependency versions
Run `npx npm-upgrade` and upgrade all packages that don't break anything.
If something breaks, try to fix it with reasonable effort.
If that doesn't help, keep the old version

### GitHub
* close all open issues in the milestone or move them to another one
* close the milestone

## Automated tests

### Unit Tests
There must be no errors.

* `npm run test`

### Linting
There should be no errors and as few warnings as possible.
Configured in `.eslintrc.json`.
Can be integrated into IDEs and editors like Atom.

* `npx eslint js`
* Some errors can be fixed automatically via `npx eslint js --fix`.

## Manual tests
All manual tests need to be successfull.
Some browsers don't allow ES6 modules and throw a CORS error when run from the file system, for example Chromium.
In this case, create a local web server and test it on localhost.
For example, run `python -m http.server` and open it at `http://0.0.0.0:8000/index-dev.html`.

* run index-dev.html in different browsers
* the most important test: it needs to load without errors. Make sure to open the console groups.
* clear the cache and local storage and try to load again (press F5)
* test all the filters (by turning them on and off)
* press reset view
* hide inter-ontology relations
* press recalculate layout
* show inter-ontology relations again and recalculate
* test the day mode (options)
* test all links (under Services and Help)
* test the zoom element (panzoom)
* try if the language switches from english to german to farsi and back to english
* search for something
* highlight all entries
* mark one of the entries (in the inner circle) and choose path
* check if the path is displayed and the labels (on nodes and edges) are existing (scroll in)
* reset view
* mark one entry, display starpath, doublestar, circlestar, star in the same way
* reset view
* mark one entry, mark another, display the spiderworm and check for labels and agility
* reset view
* remove at least one node and one edge using the contextmenu and del-button
* check if the description, LodLive and the other entries in the contextmenu are working

## Publish the release
* add, commit and push the release commit  
* create the release on GitHub, attach package-lock.json to the assets
* ssh bruchtal
* `cd /var/www/html/snik_prod/graph`
* pgraph analogously with `/var/www/html/snik_prod/pgraph`
* fulfill the code preparations
* perform the unit

## Bruchtal configuration
The server belongs to Sebastian St√§ubert.
If you are cleared for access, give him your public SSH key.
Due to firewall changes, you can only access bruchtal through a proxy jump over star.
To pull from GitHub over SSH, you need agent forwarding.
All in all, you need the following .ssh/config entries:

    Host bruchtal
    Hostname bruchtal.imise.uni-leipzig.de
    ProxyJump star
    ForwardAgent yes
    User snik

    Host star
    Hostname star.imise.uni-leipzig.de
    User insertusernamehere

Then you can simply connect via `ssh bruchtal`.
Be careful and don't mess with the other services running on the server.

## Babel procedure (not used anymore)

* supports outdated browsers
* should not be necessary anymore because since its inception in 2016, ES6 modules have become supported by all major browsers
* if supporting 2016 browsers becomes necessary again or new bleeding edge features are used that are not yet widely supported, discuss using Babel again
* state of early 2020: there is a conflict regarding `"type" : "module"` in `package.json`, which Mocha needs but Babel does not accept
* `npm run build` (runs Webpack and Babel)
* instead of index-dev.html, use index-prod.html
